## BRazilian Wax
Created in 2016 by two Brazilian women “Brazilian WAXxx” is a “bloco”
(a street parade singing a theme song) bringing Brazilian street Carnaval
culture to Brunswick, Melbourne. This ‘Bloco’ aims to provoke reflection
around ‘why we associate Brazil with intimate waxing services?’ ‘Are
Brazilian women expected to be bare down under?’

How did it come to be that the name of an entire nation be rendered
synonymous to complete intimate hair removal?

‘SAVE THE BRAZILIAN AMAZON’ is the first original song composed for
the ‘bloco’. In an ironic way we raise the discussion about the criminal
deforestation occurring every day in forests around the world, relating
this to the cultural nonsense of assuming that a woman should keep her
wetlands totally deforested.

Perhaps people could pay more attention to the Earth’s wellbeing than
making assumptions about a woman’s pubic hair.
