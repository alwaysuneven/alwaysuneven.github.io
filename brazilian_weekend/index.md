15th & 16th September 2018 

Always Uneven in partnership with La Peñita Del Neruda cafe put together the ‘Brazilian Weekend’ with live music, South American empanadas, beer and wine. 
The guitar duo Rasteiro played on Saturday their originals and Brazilian Bossa Nova with a jazzy flavour. For this show Maurizio Gulina and Marcelo Garcia invited Tiago Ucella and Julia Calasso to play percussion alongside them.

On Sunday we had Tide performing his solo project. Tide is a very talented guitarist player and lead singer of the bands, ‘Rua’ & ‘Vento Pipa’. In his solo project he uses a wide range of percussive instruments and a loop pedal to accompany his guitar and voice. The result is an organic and authentic style of Brazilian music.
