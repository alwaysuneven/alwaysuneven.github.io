## Engaging with local community

On 15th & 16th September 2018 
Always Uneven in partnership with [Neruda's Brunskick](http://www.cafenerudas.com.au) put together the ‘Brazilian Weekend’ with live music, South American empanadas, beer and wine. 
The guitar duo Rasteiro played on Saturday their originals songs and some Brazilian Bossa Nova with a jazzy flavour. For this gig Maurizio Gulina and Marcelo Garcia invited Tiago Ucella and Julia Calasso to play percussion alongside them.

On Sunday we had Tide performing his solo project. Tide is a very talented guitarist player and lead singer of the bands, ‘Rua’ & ‘Vento Pipa’. In his solo project he uses a wide range of percussive instruments and a loop pedal to accompany his guitar and voice. The result is an organic and authentic style of Brazilian music.
