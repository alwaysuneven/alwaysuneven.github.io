<p>
With a passion for multiculturalism and social justice Julia recognises  important tools in the arts to promote fairness and equality in society and to create interesting and enjoyable communities. She is fascinated by the power of storytelling, particularly our own stories, and believes pluralism and diversity make positive impacts in people's lives. Initially trained as an actress in her home town in Brazil she migrated to Australia in 2013. Since then, questions around migration, identity, multiculturalism and inclusion have been nurturing her artistic endeavours.

Driven by an urge to create an inclusive community of creatives, aligned with the desire to take artists to new spaces and to develop a multidisciplinary and culturally diverse arts program, in 2016 she started the arts platform Always Uneven. Through this initiative she has had the opportunity to explore a multitude of themes and ideas in collaboration with a number of artists and art spaces. Taking the need to adapt and reinvent herself as a world citizen as an opportunity for professional development, Julia has been expanding her skills as creative producer, artistic director, arts programmer, emcee and performer.  

Enthusiastic about discussing the arts and cultural agendas, she understands creativity as a way to question aspects of society and provoke critical thinking both in creatives and audiences. She celebrates Melbourneâ€™s multicultural arts community and actively advocates for diversity in management levels. As well as a Bachelor in Drama, she has a Masters in Arts Management from RMIT. She is seeking an opportunity to work for a meaningful organisation that reflects similar values and mission.
