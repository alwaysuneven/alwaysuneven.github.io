## Loop Sessions

In the fifth edition of ‘Live in the Gallery’ we celebrated the vibes of Live Looping. 

Live looping is the art of recording layers upon layers live in real-time in front of an audience creating an entire performance. 

We were pleased to have a DJ opening the evening and honoured to have two artists with such different backgrounds playing live. 

Daniel Al Gusto is a Dj, producer and musician and has been involved with music since he was 12. His music travels from Hip Hop and Brazilian grooves to Afrobeat, Jazz and more.

Seeking for lightness through his music, Mellow weaves melodies and harmonies into colourful looping textures opening to other sounds perspectives. Guitar, violin and melodica get together whilst Mellow spreads smooth vocals out. 

BRazaman is a Reggae singer/songwriter spreading conscious music and lyrics inspired by the principles of the Rasfar movement ‘Word, Sound and Power’. 

Along with those performances the Magnet Galley held a father and son exhibition portraying the urban facets of Melbourne and Tokyo. By Michael and Jacob Silver.
