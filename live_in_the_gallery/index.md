'Live in the Gallery' is an event that brings live performances to a gallery space. 

This event combines different artistic forms such as fine arts, photo, music, dance, poetry in one experience. What is going to happen as result of this combination is always a surprise for audience and artists involved. 

The event has a ‘Pay as you Feel’ entry fee. Audience is asked to buy their tickets paying the amount is possible for them, and the amount they feel art worths for them. How much is it?
